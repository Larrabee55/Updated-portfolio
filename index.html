          My name is Cameron and I am 20 years old. I grew up in Utah and a have lived here for my whole life. I
          graduated from Taylorsville high school in 2016 and have been attending Salt lake Community college since
          then! I am currently working full time as a leasing agent and a student in the University of Utah coding
          bootcamp. My goal after this bootcamp is get a good career in computer science. I will start by getting a job
          in web development or computer related field and will continue to go to school so I can learn as much as I can
          about computer science and advance up to a computer engineer or software engineer.

            This assignment was coded the third week of the bootcamp after learning Javascript! When the user loads
            into the page it picks a word from the array of words randomly and puts a underline for every letter in the
            word,the user can then start guessing letters in the word, if the user guesses right then it displays the
            letter
            in the space of the underline was holding. If the user gueses wrong it puts it the the letters guessed wrong
            area. If the user input 13 wrong letters then it prompts the user that they lost and asks with they want to
            play again. If the user guesses the word before they run out of guesses it adds one to the wins variable
            then it prompts the user they won and if they want to play again. If the user hits play again it picks
            another random word from the array for the user to guess.

            This assignment was done in the fourth week of the bootcamp after learning jQuery. When the user loads into
            the page the game starts and
            allows the user to choose a character out of the three availble. Once user chooses a character it moves the
            remaining to the characters available to attack the user then has to choose a its opponent, once the
            opponent is chosen the user can start attacking. everytime the user presses the attack button it minuses off
            the random attack off the enemies hp after the users attack is taken off the opponents hp the opponent
            attacks your character and takes it off you hp. this goes til one is out of HP. If the opponent runs out of
            HP the it removes them from the game and allows the user to fight the second character and it repeats the
            fight process. If the user runs out of HP before his opponent then it removes your Character and user loses.

            it pulls up the first question and starts the timer. The User is asked a questions and has options for its
            answer. The User can click on any of the options for their answer. If the users answer is the right answer

            users answer is wrong it displays a picture for 3 seconds and tells the user they are wrong then displays
            next question. If the user doesn't answer the question it displays the picture and tells the user they did
            not answer Once it has gone through all questions it displays how many questons the user got right, wrong,
            and how many unanswered.
